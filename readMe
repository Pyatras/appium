ReadMe for kindred home assignment.

Dear kindred reviewer, please have a look at my attempt to complete the assignment.
Unfortunately my skills with java are not as good as my swift skills.
In this assignment I have made 3 simple automated tests:
- simple test to check the visibility of search box.
- simple test to check the negative search results that are completely unrelated.
- simple test to check the positive search results.

In this assignment I tried to reproduce a very simple page object model:
- BaseClass contains setup information.
- BaseTest contains all methods used for tests.
- TestData contains all test data used in tests.
- Tests contain all 3 tests

If I would have more time then I would also test:
- Minimum character search request.
- Maximum character search request.
- More elements to check for presence in blog page.
- More elements to check for presence in search results page.
- Presence or absence of images in search result depending on search request.
- Presence and interactivity of top page menu.
